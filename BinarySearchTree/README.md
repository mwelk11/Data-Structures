# BST-Data-Structure

This is the implementation of a Binary Search Tree data structure.
Includes test cases using JUnit.

The following methods are implemented:
 - insert() - inserts a value into the tree in the proper position.
 - search() - return true/false if a value is present in the tree.
 - delete() - delete a node in the tree.
 - deleteTree() - delete all nodes in the tree.
 - getHeight() - return the height of the tree. Height is defined as the number of nodes in the longest path from the root to a leaf.
 - getNodeCount() - return total node count of the tree.
 - getLeafCount() - return total leaf node count of the tree. A leaf node is defined as a node with no children.
 - getMin() - return the minimum value in the tree.
 - getMax() - return the maximum value in the tree.
 - inOrderTraversal() - return a list of values representing the in-order traversal of the tree.
 - preOrderTraversal() - return a list of values representing the pre-order traversal of the tree.
 - postOrderTraversal() - return a list of values representing the post-order traversal of the tree.
